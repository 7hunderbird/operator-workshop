# lab-0 preparation

These are the steps to get the the labs ready as an instructor.

## Student Workspaces

Why a VM on the cloud as the workspace?

It allows users to have any local platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) and not need anything more than internet access, a modern OS and web browser.

The hope is this provides a quick, level playing field for all students in attendance.

### Setup Student VPC Network

Find the VPC Networks section, click on **Create VPC Network**.

The required fields are the name of the network, name of the subnet, which region to use and an IP address range.

Here's a sensible default if you'd like:

  * student-network1
  * student-subnet1
  * us-west1
  * `192.168.100.0/24`

The `192.168.x.x` recommendation is to avoid networks generated by terraform that use 10.x.x.x ranges.

### Open SSH on the `student-network-1`

Go to VPC networks > **Firewall rules**

Create a firewall rule.

  * name: **allow-ssh**
  * network: **student-network1**
  * targets: **All instances in the network**
  * source IP ranges: **0.0.0.0/0**
  * specified protocols and ports: **tcp:22**

### Workspace VMs

We need to have a unique workspace vm for each student.  These are the servers that the students ssh into over a web browser and issue commands.  Use the 2vcpu n1-highcpu-2 so we can compile faster.

Under Compute Engine, **Create an Instance** for each student.

  * name: student-workspace-**n**
  * zone: near your location
  * machine type: **n1-highcpu-2**
  * boot disk: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
  * identity and API access: **Allow full access to all Cloud APIs**

Under the Management, disks, networking, SSH keys, switch to the **Networking** tab.

Change the Network interface tab to the **student-network-1**.

**Create** the VM.
