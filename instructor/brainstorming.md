with one instructor and two teacher's assistant's

break the students into two groups

when there are times to do the jigsaw technique my mom was talking about.

This is when there are times to let the groups individually figure out how to do something.

Maybe I let them figure out how to create a "delete-environment" task?
Why would they need to delete an environment?  Have them come up with use-cases.

This could also be a good way for them to start to explore more about using the bosh command line and getting "help" for finding command line "commands."

If you lose the state file it can be recovered only if you can determine specific
variables from your infrastructure and regenerate it by using the `create-env`
command.
