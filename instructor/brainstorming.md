### how-to-recover

If you lose the state file it can be recovered only if you can determine specific
variables from your infrastructure and regenerate it by using the `create-env`
command.

### good-things-tested

I can just add people to the project.  That was good to know.

  * good networking architecture
  * up the quotas of cpus or reconfigure the vpcs to be in different regions

### big-picture

more beginner
more advanced

more interested
less interested

I want to make people more interested and more prepared for BOSH.

### abstract-items
